## Introduction

In our [PySpark tutorial video](https://youtu.be/EB8lfdxpirM), we covered various topics, including Spark installation, SparkContext, SparkSession, RDD transformations and actions, Spark DataFrames, Spark SQL, and more. These Jupyter notebooks are designed to complement the video content, allowing you to follow along, experiment, and practice your PySpark skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Jupyter notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coder2j/pyspark-tutorial.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.

3. Follow the YouTube video part 2: Spark Installation to make sure Spark has been installed on your machine.

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the notebook you want to work on and start experimenting with PySpark.

## Notebook Descriptions
